# Getting Started
## Database Setup

Run `db/schema.sql` on your MySQL server using phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI before starting the application.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
